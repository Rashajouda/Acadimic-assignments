# Data Structures – Circular Linked List Implementation

**Course:** Data Structures  
**Repository:** Academic Assignments  

---

## 📌 Description

This project contains a **C++ implementation of a Circular Linked List**.

It demonstrates several core data structure concepts such as:

- Dynamic memory allocation  
- Circular node traversal  
- Insertion at head, tail, or after a specific value  
- Deleting nodes by position  
- Searching for values  
- Counting nodes  
- Using classes and encapsulation to organize the list logic  

The implementation includes two classes: **Node** and **CircularLinkedList**, following object-oriented programming principles.

## 🧱 Classes

### 🔹 Node

Represents an element in the circular list and contains:

- `data` – integer value  
- `next` – pointer to the next node  
- Getter/setter functions for all attributes  

---

### 🔹 CircularLinkedList

Represents the entire circular linked list and provides:

#### ✔ Basic Operations  
- Check if the list is empty  
- Print all nodes  
- Count nodes  

#### ✔ Insertion  
- Add node to **head**  
- Add node to **tail**  
- Insert a new node **after a specific value**  

#### ✔ Deletion  
- Delete from **head**  
- Delete from **tail**  
- Delete from **a specific position**  

#### ✔ Utility  
- Search for a value and return its index  
- Destructor that safely frees all allocated nodes
