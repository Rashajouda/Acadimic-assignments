# Data Structures - Linked List Implementation

**Course:** Data Structures  
**Repository:** Academic Assignments  

## Description
This project contains a **C++ implementation of a singly linked list**. It demonstrates the core concepts of data structures including:

- Dynamic memory allocation.
- Node insertion and deletion at head, tail, or specific positions.
- Searching, updating, and copying nodes.
- Finding maximum and minimum values.
- Counting nodes and checking if the list is empty.

The implementation uses classes and encapsulation for **Node** and **LinkedList**, emphasizing object-oriented programming concepts.

## Classes

### Node
Represents a single element in the linked list with:
- `data` (integer value)
- `ptr` (pointer to the next node)
- Getter and setter methods for data and pointer.

### LinkedList
Represents the singly linked list with:
- `head` (pointer to the first node)
- Methods for insertion, deletion, updating, searching, copying, and printing nodes.
- Destructor to properly free allocated memory.

## Features
- Add a node to **head** or **tail**
- Add a node **after** or **before** a specific value
- Delete a node **at a specific position**, **before**, **after**, or **by value**
- Update a node at a given position
- Find **max**, **min**, and **position** of a value
- Count nodes
- Copy a linked list to another list
- Print the linked list
- Check if the list is empty
